<h2>Covered with a Covering: The reason for Divine Secrecy</h2>
<h3>by Daniel Lyle</h3>
<blockquote>WOE to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:(Isaiah 30:1)</blockquote>
<p>
Throughout the scriptures there are numerous examples where the Lord or His servants disguise themselves, hide themselves and others or conceal information for righteous purposes.  The prophet Abraham didn't disclose that Sarah was his wife on several occasions where men of power might have slain him out of jealous lust for Sarah's beauty.  Jacob pretended to be Esau in order to secure the birthright blessing Esau had previously sold him.  Jacob's son Joseph who was sold into Egypt by his own brothers used secrecy and strategem to reunite himself with his father and family years later.  Jeremiah in the Old Testament refrained from telling the princes all that he had discussed with King Zedekiah.  The wise men who visited the baby Jesus were warned of God not to return to Herod with their report, but departed into their own country by another way.  Saul, a Jew who repented of his persecution of Christ's disciples after seeing a light from heaven, was secretly let down over the walls of Damascus in a basket by Christ's disciples in order to escape those Jews who now saw him as an enemy worthy of death and waited by the city gates to slay him.  Nephi in the Book of Mormon dressed himself up in all of Laban's clothing and armor after slaying Laban by God's commandment.</p>
<p>When is concealment dishonest?  When is deception unrighteous?
</p>
<p>Proverbs 12:22-23 provides some insights into these questions when it juxtaposes the concept of lying as an abomination to God while emphasizing that full disclosure of what one knows to anyone or everyone can be just as foolish.</p> 
<p>So how are we to know what and when we should prudently conceal certain knowledge in our possession?  The passage of scripture in Isaiah 30:1 quoted at the beginning of this book provides a simple rule we can follow to determine when and when not to conceal knowledge.  We are to abide by the truth as imparted to us by God's counsel often illuminated through listening to His spirit.  Being dishonest to ourselves and others in order to mislead and thereby continue in sinful behavior by postponing accountability only leads to greater troubles as we vainly try to suppress the promptings of our conscience.</p>
<p>Sometimes strategem and concealment is used for a righteous purpose.  Let's return to the example of Joseph son of Jacob who was sold into Egypt.  Joseph overcame his slavery and rose to power in Egypt through his righteousness and the grace of God in helping him interpret a dream of Pharoah's while yet in prison.  This correct interpretation earned Joseph honor and liberty. The wisdom revealed through him by God in interpreting the Pharoah's dream as a divine warning against a coming famine helped prepare Egypt against the coming disaster.  Not only did Egypt become prepared, but it served as a refuge and storehouse against hunger for countless people in the surrounding region who petitioned for aid from the graineries of Egypt.  As a mighty man in Egypt, Joseph saw his brothers come into Egypt to buy food to survive the famine.  He seized this as an opportunity to reunite his family and used strategem to conceal his true identity until he could accomplish this by cleverly manipulating his once deceitful brethren through fear brought on by a trick of righteous deception.  Joseph tricked his brethen into learning the lesson they so urgently needed that loving others and letting go of their selfish preoccupations would bring them the greatest joy in life.  Joseph initially accused his brethen of being spies when they came into Egypt and demanded that they return with their youngest brother Benjamin.  In order to ensure this would happen, Joseph demanded that they leave one of them behind as a guarantee.  Simeon stayed in Egypt as a guarantee that they would eventually return with Benjamin.  Joseph then sent them back home to their father Jacob with sacks of grain to nourish their families, but put the money the brothers had used to pay for the grain back in their sacks.  This worried his brothers for they thought that the stern Egpytian who they didn't know was their brother Joseph would think they were robbers.  Their father Jacob refused to send Benjamin to Egypt to ransom Simeon for fear that he would lose yet another son and the only full blood brother of his son Joseph who he thought he had already lost to death.  The famine continued in the land and finally forced Joseph's brethren to return to Egypt to buy more food.  They finally convinced their father to allow them to return with Benjamin since they had been told that they couldn't return unless they returned with their youngest brother. Upon returning to Egpyt, Joseph's brothers still didn't learn Joseph's true identity but were sent back home with sacks of grain.  Joseph secretly put a silver cup in the sack of the youngest brother Benjamin and had his servant pursue his brothers and accuse them of theft.  The accused brethren then returned to Egpyt and pled for mercy.  They implored Joseph to allow Benjamin to return home and imprison them instead of Benjamin.  They knew that if Benjamin didn't return home that their father would die of grief.  At this plea, Joseph finally revealed his identity, forgave his brothers and told them how God had turned that unfortunate event into a blessing by using Joseph's forced stay in Egpyt as an opportunity to save a lot of people including Joseph's family from famine.  Joseph reunited his family and uncovered the lie that his brother's had told their father when they sold him into Egypt. Joseph's brothers had deceived their father into thinking he had been killed.  Joseph's brothers repented of the evil they had done unto Joseph and more importantly they were given a great opportunity to put the life and welfare of another above their own.</p>
