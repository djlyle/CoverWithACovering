<h2>Covered with a Covering: The reason for Divine Secrecy</h2>
<h3>by Daniel Lyle</h3>
<blockquote>WOE to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:(Isaiah 30:1)</blockquote>
<p>
Throughout the scriptures there are numerous examples where the Lord or His servants disguise themselves or conceal information for righteous purposes.  The prophet Abraham didn't disclose that Sarah was his wife on several occasions where men of power might have slain him out of jealous lust for Sarah's beauty.  Jacob pretended to be Esau in order to secure the birthright blessing Esau had previously sold him.  Jeremiah in the Old Testament refrained from telling the princes all that he had discussed with King Zedekiah. Nephi in the Book of Mormon dressed himself up in all of Laban's clothing and armor after slaying Laban by God's commandment.</p>
<p>When is concealment dishonest?  When is deception unrighteous?
</p>
<p>Proverbs 12:22-23 provides some insights into these questions when it juxtaposes the concept of lying as an abomination to God while emphasizing that full disclosure of what one knows to anyone or everyone can be just as foolish.</p> 
<p>So how are we to know what and when we should prudently conceal certain knowledge in our possession?  The passage of scripture in Isaiah 30:1 quoted at the beginning of this book provides a simple rule we can follow to determine when and when not to conceal knowledge.  We are to abide by the truth as imparted to us by God's counsel often illuminated through listening to His spirit.  Being dishonest to ourselves and others in order to mislead and thereby continue in sinful behavior by postponing accountability only leads to greater troubles as we vainly try to suppress the promptings of our conscience.</p>
